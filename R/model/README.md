<h1>
SwitftRKey: The Text Typing Prediction Library
</h1>
</center>
<br/>

Overview
--------

The purpose of this library is encapsulating the [text predicting model created previously](../notebook/) as well as code to generate predictions using the model.

Installation Instructions
-------------------------

This package can be installed from GitHub using the `devtools` package. If you don't have it already, install `devtools` with the following command:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
```

Then run the following th install the text prediction library:

``` r
library("devtools")
install_github("marciogualtieri/SwifRKey", subdir="R/model/swifrkey")
```

Usage
-----

First of all, load the library in the R environment:

``` r
suppressMessages(library(swiftrkey))
```

You might get help by running the following command on RStudio's console:

``` r
?suggestions
```

### Examples of Usage

``` r
suggestions(model, "new", n = 3)
```

    ## [[1]]
    ## [1] "york"
    ## 
    ## [[2]]
    ## [1] "jersey"
    ## 
    ## [[3]]
    ## [1] "year"

``` r
suggestions(model, "new york", n = 3)
```

    ## [[1]]
    ## [1] "city"
    ## 
    ## [[2]]
    ## [1] "s"
    ## 
    ## [[3]]
    ## [1] "just"

If you want to know the probabilities for each suggestion, you may run the following command instead:

``` r
suggestions(model, "new", n = 3, with_probabilities = TRUE)
```

    ## $`0.579710144927536`
    ## [1] "york"
    ## 
    ## $`0.247427011132115`
    ## [1] "jersey"
    ## 
    ## $`0.173913043478261`
    ## [1] "year"

The `model` object is a Markov transition matrix, which is loaded with the library by default. In future releases I may add other models, e.g. for different languages (like`model_german` and `model_french`) or generated by different methods (I have used Katz backoff, for more details refer to the [notebook](../notebook)).

Developer Guide
---------------

In the next sections, follow instructions for creating a R library for my own future reference.

### Setup

You will need the following packages for R package development:

``` r
install.packages(c("devtools", "roxygen2", "knitr"))
install.packages("mixtools")
```

### Load the Libraries

``` r
library("devtools")
library("roxygen2")
library("knitr")
```

### Create the Package Directory

``` r
create("swiftrkey")
```

### Build & Reload Package

To build your package, go to RStudio's menu, then `Build` &gt; `Build and Reload`, or using the command-line:

    $ R CMD INSTALL --no-multiarch --with-keep.source swiftrkey
