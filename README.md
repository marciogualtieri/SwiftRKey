# SwitftRKey: A typing prediction app written in R

This is the root repository for the project of an application that employs text-mining and natural language processing to do text typing prediction (similar to the ones seen in mobile text messaging apps).

This app has been inspired by [SwiftKey](https://swiftkey.com/en) and it isn't intended for commercial use, but to showcase my skills as a data scientist and a developer.

You should probably navigate this project in the following order:

- Text-mining, Natural Language Processing and Exploratory Data Analysis: Check the [project's notebook](./R/notebook).

- Model Usage: Check the [R library that encapsulates the prediction algorithm](./R/model).

- Data product demonstrating the use of the text prediction algorithm. Check the [SwiftRKey app](./R/app).
