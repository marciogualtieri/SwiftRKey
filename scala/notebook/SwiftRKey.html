Spark 2.x is behind regarding some critical dependencies for this notebook (e.g., Spark 2.x still uses shapeless 2.0.0 while the latest available one is 2.3.2).\n\n### Required Imports\n\nYou will need to import these dependencies from the Maven Repository using the databricks' UI:\n\n- [zt-zip](https://github.com/zeroturnaround/zt-zip): Zip file utilities.\n- [Stanford's CoreNLP](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/): You will need the core library and the models (separated jar). The core library is available as a Maven resource, but the [models](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/download.html) need to be downloaded as well and uploaded to databricks using the UI.\n- [plotly-scala](https://github.com/alexarchambault/plotly-scala): Scala binding for [Plotly charts](https://plot.ly/).\n- [jfreechart](http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/samples.html): Only for the image encoding utils.\n- [kumo-core](https://github.com/kennycason/kumo): Word cloud generator.\n\nThese are already present in the databricks' environment (no action required):\n\n- [commons-io](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-io/): File utilties.\n\n### References\n\nGiven that the databricks environment doesn't support code completion (at least as I write this notebook), the following links might be useful.\n\nDatabricks:\n\n- [Databricks Utilities - dbutils](https://docs.databricks.com/user-guide/dbutils.html)\n- [Databricks File System - DBFS](https://docs.databricks.com/user-guide/dbfs-databricks-file-system.html)\n\nExternal:\n\n- [commons-io::FileUtils](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-io/javadocs/api-2.5/org/apache/commons/io/FileUtils.html)\n- [commons-io::FilenameUtils](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-io/javadocs/api-1.4/org/apache/commons/io/FilenameUtils.html)\n\n## Synopsis\n\nThe purpose of this notebook is showing my Spark/Scala data science skills, specifically for text-mining. Given that a lot of the available \"big data\" comes from the web in unstructured form, text-mining and natural language processing have become important tools for data science.\n\nIn this notebook I will cover:\n\n- Downloding data from the web into a databricks environment.\n- ETL of a corpus of text.\n- Using of the Stanford's CoreNLP library to do tokenization and lemmatization.\n- Creating interactive web plots using Plotly.\n- Creating word clouds using the Kumo library.\n\nThis notebook also corresponds to the data analytics phase for the development of a keyboard typing prediction app named \"SwiftRKey\", which is my submission to Coursera's Data Science Capstone Project (from Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization). The Capstone project is suppose to be completed with R (I also have a R Notebook), but I decided to implement the project in Spark/Scala as well to showcase my skills.","commandVersion":0,"state":"finished","results":null,"errorSummary":null,"error":null,"workflows":[],"startTime":0,"submitTime":1497031039637,"finishTime":0,"collapsed":false,"bindings":{},"inputWidgets":{},"displayType":"table","width":"auto","height":"auto","xColumns":null,"yColumns":null,"pivotColumns":null,"pivotAggregation":null,"customPlotOptions":{},"commentThread":[],"commentsVisible":false,"parentHierarchy":[],"diffInserts":[],"diffDeletes":[],"globalVars":{},"latestUser":"a
